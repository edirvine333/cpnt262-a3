## NOTES  

1.  I burned Assignment 2 and started again with what I'm hoping are the bare minimum requirements for this assignment.  I will make the appropriate changes to this assignment to meet the requirements of Assignment 4.  
2.  No CSS and bare minimum HTML, by design.   


## ATTRIBUTIONS  

-  research on the dotenv Node.js module, the .env file, and the environment variable at (https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
